You fiend!

As you dare to face me I have no choice but to tell you about myself,
However PREPARE YOURSELF... This words will lead you to insanity!!!

I was born from the depths of darkness by the time the winds brought us the freezing air from the norse mountains and raised in the heat of hell at the south american lands. 

I dance in the chaos of war in Battlefield;
I give punishment to whose dare to murder in Danganronpa;
I have killed Hundreds of Demons in darkness and light in Dark Souls and Bloodborne;
And other thousands of demons and fiends like you;
NOW BEHOLD MY POWER!!!!!!!!!!
FUHUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
